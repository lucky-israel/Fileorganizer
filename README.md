# Fileorganizer
Building a GitHub repository clone of a local VM machine file organizer.




This is a script designed to organize files into folders based on their types (e.g., images, documents, others). 


Itâ€™s a nice script, manually created as a clone for a local Rocky Linux machine.


The script categorizes files by their extensions, moves them into appropriate directories, and logs all actions, making file management efficient and straightforward.
